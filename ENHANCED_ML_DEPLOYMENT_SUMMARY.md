### 🤖 Enhanced ML Capabilities

#### Outlier Detection
- Trained on 2,000+ synthetic invoices enhanced with real-world patterns
- Detects unusual rate/hour/amount combinations
- 10% contamination rate for production sensitivity

#### Rate Analysis
- Compares individual rates against practice area benchmarks
- Calculates standard deviation scores vs. market
- Identifies rates >2 standard deviations outside normal ranges

#### Spend Prediction  
- Analyzes spending velocity and patterns
- Forecasts future period costs
- Breaks down spend by practice area and role

### 🔍 Demonstration Results
