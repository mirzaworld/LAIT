JS HEAP OUT OF MEMORY ISSUE - SOLUTION SUMMARY
==============================================

If you see the error "Worker terminated due to reaching memory limit: JS heap out of memory",
follow these steps to resolve it:

1. Use increased memory allocation:
   - Run with: npm run start-optimized
   - This automatically increases memory and starts the app

2. Monitor memory usage:
   - Run: npm run memory-check
   - Review output and memory_analysis.txt for insights

3. Memory optimizations implemented:
   - File size limits (10MB max)
   - Chunked file processing
   - Limited batch uploads (5 files max)
   - Sequential file processing
   - Improved cleanup of temporary files

4. For developers:
   - See docs/MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md for detailed guidelines
   - Large model files and libraries were identified as potential memory issues
   - Consider further pagination optimizations for large datasets

5. Production deployment:
   - Ensure NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=4096' is set
   - Configure proper server resources in production environments
   - Use memory monitoring in production

These changes have been implemented and the system should now handle file uploads
and data processing without memory errors.
