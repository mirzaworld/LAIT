# LAIT Project Status

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

Enhanced Legal Intelligence System (LAIT) now features a reliable, production-ready integration between frontend and backend components. The system is designed to analyze legal spend data, provide insights through interactive charts, and offer real-time notifications when relevant.

## ðŸš€ Completed Tasks

### Backend

- âœ… Unified all backend functionality into `enhanced_app.py`
- âœ… Added Socket.IO support for real-time notifications
- âœ… Improved API response consistency and error handling
- âœ… Created health check endpoints for system monitoring

### Frontend

- âœ… Fixed critical rendering issues in SpendChart component
- âœ… Fixed data handling issues in RecentInvoices component
- âœ… Added data transformation to handle different API response formats
- âœ… Improved error handling across all API calls
- âœ… Added conditional Socket.IO connection with proper error handling

### Testing & Documentation

- âœ… Created component_test.cjs script for API verification
- âœ… Updated documentation with clear instructions
- âœ… Generated FRONTEND_FIXES.md with detailed change log
- âœ… Added API diagnostics tools

## ðŸ”§ Environment Setup

The project is configured with the following defaults:

- Backend API runs on `http://localhost:5003`
- Frontend development server runs on `http://localhost:5173`
- Socket.IO is disabled by default (enable with `VITE_SOCKET_ENABLED=true` in `.env`)

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Installation

1. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   python backend/enhanced_app.py
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Run the component test script to verify API connectivity:

   ```bash
   node component_test.cjs
   ```

4. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks (Optional)

1. Address React Router v7 future flag warnings (not breaking)
2. Add React Error Boundaries for even more robust error handling
3. Consider implementing a more sophisticated Socket.IO reconnection strategy

## ðŸ“ˆ Next Steps for Enhancement

1. Add end-to-end tests using Cypress or Playwright
2. Create Docker containers for easier deployment
3. Implement user authentication system
4. Add data filtering capabilities to charts
