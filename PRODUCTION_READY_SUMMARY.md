3. **Community Trends**: Increased demand for data privacy and ESG compliance expertise

## üåê Deployment Options

### **Option 1: Railway Deployment (Recommended)**
```bash
# Use the existing Railway configuration
./deploy-railway.sh
```

### **Option 2: Manual Production Deployment**
```bash
# Use the production deployment script
./deploy-production.sh
```

### **Option 3: Docker Deployment**
```bash
# Build and run with Docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## üîß Local Development

```bash
# Backend (Terminal 1)
cd /Users/mirza/Documents/GitHub/LAIT
python3 backend/single_root_app.py

# Frontend (Terminal 2)
npm run dev

# Live Data Ingestion (Optional)
python3 ingest_live_data.py
```

**Access URLs:**
