# Frontend Error Fixes - Pull Request

This PR fixes several issues in the frontend application, focusing on error handling and API connectivity.

## Changes Made

### 1. SpendChart Component

- Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')" error by adding better null/undefined checks
- Added defensive coding to handle missing dataset structures

### 2. RecentInvoices Component

- Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLocaleString')" error by adding a null check for invoice amounts

### 3. Socket.IO Integration

- Added Socket.IO support to the enhanced_app.py backend
- Updated useNotifications hook to conditionally attempt socket connections
- Added error handling for socket connection failures
- Added VITE_SOCKET_ENABLED environment variable to control socket usage

### 4. Data Structure Handling in useApi.ts

- Enhanced useSpendTrends hook with better error handling
- Added defensive programming to ensure proper data structures
- Fixed edge cases with period filtering and aggregation

### 5. Dependencies

- Added flask-socketio to requirements.txt
- Verified frontend dependencies (recharts, socket.io-client)

## Notes

- React Router warnings about v7 functionality are informational only and don't affect application functionality
- Socket.IO is now properly configured but disabled by default (to enable, set VITE_SOCKET_ENABLED=true in .env)

## Testing

1. Verified SpendChart renders correctly with backend data
2. Verified RecentInvoices renders correctly with backend data
3. Confirmed API connectivity to `http://localhost:5003`
4. Socket.IO errors are suppressed when disabled
