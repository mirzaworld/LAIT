- ‚úÖ **Secure & scalable**: Production-grade authentication and architecture
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive**: Full-stack solution with proper documentation

### Immediate Focus:
The primary remaining work is **frontend-backend integration** to make the React dashboard fully interactive. The backend provides all necessary APIs and ML capabilities - the frontend just needs to consume them properly.

### Timeline to Full Production:
- **2-3 weeks** for complete frontend integration
- **1-2 weeks** for production deployment
- **Ongoing** for advanced features and scaling

**The foundation is solid, the models are trained, and the data is real. LAIT is ready to become a production legal tech solution.**
